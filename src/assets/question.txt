1. app.component.ts L23
    Check if a token is present at application startup (check the localStorage manually or use the Firebase SDK to do so - just make sure that you somehow wait for the SDK to finish its initialization

2. cannot commont inside array? object?

3. unit test
    can second test use property/variables defined in first test? Can test sth not defined in test but used in app?
    eg.
    it('test 1')
    let userService = ...

    it ('test 2')
    expect(...).toEqual(app.user.name)
